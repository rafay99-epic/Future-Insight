      <description>Introduction: False data injection is a type of cyber attack that occurs when an attacker alters or introduces incorrect data into a control system or its communication network. This type of attack can have serious consequences for the operation of the control system, such as loss of control, equipment damage, and even safety incidents.
False data injection attacks can take many forms, including modifying sensor readings, injecting false control commands, or altering historical data records.</description>

      <description>Introduction: So you are working on text identification or face detection, and the question that arises is which algorithm to use and what will be the performance.
I am doing a project where I need to use SVM for detecting cyber attacks, but in order to identify them, I need to learn what makes this algorithm so good. For this project, I will be learning the basics of SVM with real-world examples, and once we are done with the examples, we will try the real project.</description>

      <description>Introduction: Hi! My name is Abdul Rafay, and I work on training different models from provided data, as well as deploying the model on any of the cloud services.
When I started this journey, my teacher and mentor told me to learn math and probability in order to understand the major concepts needed to become an expert in machine learning. But most students hate math and probability because some of the concepts can be tricky to learn and might not be interesting to them.</description>

So for that, you need to learn Git and GitHub.
Before Git: But before I was using Git, My code folder structure was something like this:
Every time I was working on a project, I made a copy of that folder and then made changes to it, which led to the destruction of your application.</description>
